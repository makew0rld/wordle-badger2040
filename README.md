# Wordle on the Badger 2040

![](https://www.makeworld.space/assets/images/wordle_badger2040/main_shot.jpg)

This is code to play Wordle on the [Badger 2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040).

See [here](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-badger-2040) for how to
load this code on to your Badger. Just replace the `main.py` on your device with one in
this repo, and upload the two `.txt` files.

I wrote about this project in a [post on my blog](https://www.makeworld.space/2022/03/wordle_badger2040.html).
